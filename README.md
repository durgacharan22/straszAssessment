## Problem Statement

* There is a Testlet with a fixed set of 10 items. 6 of the items are operational and 4 of them are pretest items.
* The requirement is that the _order_ of these items should be randomized such that -
  * The first 2 items are always pretest items selected randomly from the 4 pretest items.
  * The next 8 items are mix of pretest and operational items ordered randomly from the remaining 8 items.

## Pre-requisites

1. Node.js
2. npm

## Steps to Run the application

* Clone the Application
* Open the project folder and in the root folder open terminal/git bash/command prompt and type "npm run build" to compile/transpile the application.
* Now run the command "npm run test" to see the test case results
* Run the command "npm start" to see the actual shuffled array with in the command line.
